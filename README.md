# PiPicoRubberDucky
This readme file provides an overview of the files included in the repository for the Project PiPicoRubberDucky. The repository contains the following files:

adafruit-circuitpython-bundle-8.x-mpy-20230403/adafruit-circuitpython-bundle-8.x-mpy-20230403: This directory contains the Adafruit CircuitPython bundle version 8.x with MicroPython files from April 3, 2023.

pico-ducky-main/pico-ducky-main: This directory contains the main files for the Pico Ducky project. It is utilized for programming a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller to act as a Rubber Ducky device.

readyRubberDucky: This file is a copy of the ready-to-use Raspberry Pi Pico Rubber Ducky code. It allows the Raspberry Pi Pico to emulate a USB Rubber Ducky device for executing predefined keyboard commands.

scripts: This directory contains additional scripts that can be utilized in conjunction with the project. These scripts may provide added functionality or customization options.

adafruit-circuitpython-raspberry_pi_pico-de_DE-8.0.5.uf2: This file is the CircuitPython firmware specific to the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller with German (de_DE) language localization, version 8.0.5.

flash_nuke.uf2: This file contains a custom firmware for the Raspberry Pi Pico that is used to perform a complete flash memory erase on the microcontroller.

manual.txt: This file includes the project's manual, providing instructions, guidelines, and other relevant information for using the project.

payload.dd: This file represents a payload for the Rubber Ducky device. It contains the predefined keyboard commands that can be executed when the Raspberry Pi Pico is acting as a Rubber Ducky.

Please note that the presence of the "readyRubberDucky" file means that you already have a fully functional Raspberry Pi Pico Rubber Ducky setup. You can make a copy of the "readyRubberDucky" file and use it for your own projects. Additionally, ensure that you have a working Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller to utilize this project effectively.

For detailed instructions on how to set up and use the project, please refer to the manual.txt file.
